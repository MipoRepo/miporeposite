                        I am building a technical foundation around DevOps, cloud infrastructure and AI‑assisted software development. 
                        I work with container‑based solutions, CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code to create development processes that are reliable and repeatable. 
                        I combine strategic thinking with continuous technical growth — human vision leads, and AI supports. 
                        My long‑term direction is DevSecOps, and I move toward it by adopting new technologies step by step.</p><br>

                    <p class="about-text">My earlier career — more than 20 years in the business world — gave me a strong understanding of how different industries operate and how decisions are made. 
                        That background gives me a clear view of how technical solutions must serve real business needs. 
                        I’ve brought that experience into the ICT field, where understanding a customer’s business logic is just as important as technical skills.</p>
